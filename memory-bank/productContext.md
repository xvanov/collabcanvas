# Product Context: TrueCost

## Problem & Users
- Problem: Construction estimates are often inaccurate; underbids erode profit, overbids lose jobs. Manual spreadsheets miss location factors, real-time pricing, and risk.
- Primary users: Residential GCs/subs (1–20 employees) doing remodels/additions/custom homes; secondary: trade subs (electrical/plumbing/HVAC/roofing).

## Value Proposition
- 7 specialized agents collaborate to produce accurate, risk-adjusted estimates in minutes.
- Real-time/location-aware data (labor, permits, weather), CAD-driven quantities, probabilistic outputs (P50/P80/P90), professional PDFs.
- Feedback loop compares estimates vs. actuals to improve over time.

## User Experience Goals
- Simple input (chat/voice + CAD upload), clear plan review, and editable final estimate.
- Transparency: show assumptions, agent progress, confidence intervals, and risk drivers.
- Client-ready outputs with clean, trustworthy visuals.

## Success Metrics
- Primary: Estimate accuracy (MAPE <10% target).
- Secondary: CAD extraction accuracy >95%, time to estimate <5 minutes, feedback completion >30%, user retention >70%.
