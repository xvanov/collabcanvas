Performance Optimization Plan for CollabCanvas
Current Performance Issues Identified:
Excessive Re-renders: Canvas component re-renders on every mouse move
Grid Rendering Overhead: Complex grid calculation on every render
Multiple RAF Loops: Separate RAF loops for FPS, cursor, and shapes
Inefficient Shape Mapping: Converting Map to Array on every render
Lock Overlay Recalculation: Complex useMemo calculations on every render
Throttling Conflicts: Multiple throttling mechanisms competing
Phase 1: Critical Rendering Optimizations (Target: 40-50 FPS)
Step 1.1: Optimize Canvas Mouse Move Handling
Problem: handleMouseMove triggers re-renders on every mouse movement
Solution:
Move cursor position updates to a separate RAF loop
Debounce cursor position state updates
Use useCallback with proper dependencies
Files: src/components/Canvas.tsx
Expected Impact: +15-20 FPS
Step 1.2: Optimize Grid Rendering
Problem: Grid calculation happens on every render with complex math
Solution:
Memoize grid calculations with useMemo
Only recalculate when zoom/pan changes significantly
Reduce grid line count for better performance
Files: src/components/Canvas.tsx (lines 288-344)
Expected Impact: +10-15 FPS
Step 1.3: Optimize Shape Rendering
Problem: Converting Map to Array and re-rendering all shapes
Solution:
Use React.memo with proper comparison for Shape components
Implement virtual rendering for off-screen shapes
Optimize shape list conversion
Files: src/components/Canvas.tsx, src/components/Shape.tsx
Expected Impact: +5-10 FPS
Phase 2: State Management Optimizations (Target: 50-55 FPS)
Step 2.1: Optimize Zustand Store Updates
Problem: Store updates trigger unnecessary re-renders
Solution:
Implement selective subscriptions
Use shallow comparison for store updates
Batch store updates
Files: src/store/canvasStore.ts
Expected Impact: +5-8 FPS
Step 2.2: Optimize Lock Overlay Calculations
Problem: Complex useMemo recalculates on every render
Solution:
Simplify lock overlay logic
Use more efficient data structures
Reduce lock overlay re-renders
Files: src/components/Canvas.tsx (lines 74-83)
Expected Impact: +3-5 FPS
Phase 3: RAF Loop Consolidation (Target: 55-60 FPS)
Step 3.1: Consolidate Animation Loops
Problem: Multiple RAF loops competing for resources
Solution:
Single RAF loop for all animations
Prioritize critical updates (FPS, cursor)
Batch non-critical updates
Files: src/components/Canvas.tsx, src/hooks/useShapes.ts
Expected Impact: +5-8 FPS
Step 3.2: Optimize Throttling Strategy
Problem: Multiple throttling mechanisms causing conflicts
Solution:
Unified throttling system
Adaptive throttling based on performance
Reduce throttling overhead
Files: src/utils/throttle.ts, src/hooks/useShapes.ts
Expected Impact: +3-5 FPS
Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations (Target: 60+ FPS)
Step 4.1: Implement Shape Culling
Problem: Rendering shapes outside viewport
Solution:
Only render shapes within viewport bounds
Implement efficient viewport culling
Use spatial indexing for large shape counts
Files: src/components/Canvas.tsx
Expected Impact: +5-10 FPS (scales with shape count)
Step 4.2: Optimize Konva Layer Management
Problem: Inefficient layer updates
Solution:
Separate static and dynamic layers
Use Konva caching for static elements
Optimize layer listening settings
Files: src/components/Canvas.tsx
Expected Impact: +3-5 FPS
Step 4.3: Implement Performance Monitoring
Problem: No real-time performance feedback
Solution:
Enhanced diagnostics HUD
Performance regression detection
Adaptive quality settings
Files: src/components/DiagnosticsHud.tsx
Expected Impact: Better monitoring and optimization
Phase 5: Multi-User Optimization (Target: Maintain 60 FPS with 5+ users)
Step 5.1: Optimize Presence Updates
Problem: Cursor updates causing performance degradation
Solution:
Reduce cursor update frequency
Implement cursor interpolation
Optimize presence data structure
Files: src/hooks/usePresence.ts
Expected Impact: +5-8 FPS with multiple users
Step 5.2: Optimize Firestore Sync
Problem: Firestore updates causing render blocks
Solution:
Implement update batching
Use Web Workers for sync operations
Optimize conflict resolution
Files: src/hooks/useShapes.ts
Expected Impact: +3-5 FPS
Implementation Priority:

Step 3.2: Optimize Throttling Strategy
Step 4.2: Optimize Konva Layer Management
Success Metrics:
Target FPS: 60 FPS sustained
Shape Sync Latency: < 100ms
Cursor Latency: < 50ms
Multi-user Performance: Maintain 60 FPS with 5+ concurrent users
Shape Count: Support 500+ shapes without degradation
Testing Strategy:
Performance Harness: Use existing Playwright harness to validate improvements
Manual Testing: Test with multiple browser tabs simulating users
Profiling: Use browser dev tools to identify remaining bottlenecks
Regression Testing: Ensure functional features remain intact
This plan addresses the core performance issues systematically, starting with the highest-impact optimizations and building toward the target 60 FPS performance. Each phase builds upon the previous optimizations to achieve sustainable high performance.
