# Setup & Testing Guide - PR-4 Material Estimation

## üöÄ Quick Start (Git Worktree Setup)

Since you're using git worktree, here's what you need:

### 1. Firebase Emulator Setup

**Start the Firebase emulators** (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd /Users/kalin.ivanov/rep/collabcanvas-root/issue-21-construction-ai/collabcanvas
firebase emulators:start
```

This starts:
- ‚úÖ Functions emulator: `http://127.0.0.1:5001`
- ‚úÖ Firestore emulator: `http://localhost:8080`
- ‚úÖ Auth emulator: `http://localhost:9099`
- ‚úÖ RTDB emulator: `http://localhost:9000`
- ‚úÖ Storage emulator: `http://localhost:9199`
- ‚úÖ Emulator UI: `http://localhost:4000`

### 2. Run the Dev Server

**In another terminal:**

```bash
cd /Users/kalin.ivanov/rep/collabcanvas-root/issue-21-construction-ai/collabcanvas
npm run dev
```

Opens at: `http://localhost:5173`

## üß™ Testing the AI Features

You now have **TWO AI assistants**:

### ü§ñ **AI Canvas Assistant** (Purple - Bottom Left)
**Location:** Tools ‚Üí AI Assistant  
**What to test:**

1. **Basic Shape Creation**
   ```
   "create a circle"
   "create a red rectangle"
   "add text saying Hello World"
   "create a blue line"
   ```

2. **Multiple Shapes**
   ```
   "create 3 circles"
   "create 5 red rectangles"
   ```

3. **Shape Manipulation** (select shapes first)
   ```
   "delete selected shapes"
   "duplicate selected shapes"
   "align selected shapes left"
   ```

4. **Color Changes** (select shapes first)
   ```
   "make selected shapes red"
   "change color to blue"
   ```

5. **Layer Operations**
   ```
   "create a layer called Walls"
   "move selected shapes to Walls layer"
   ```

**Expected behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Chat scrolls as you add commands
- ‚úÖ Shows success/failure for each command
- ‚úÖ Displays created/modified/deleted shape counts
- ‚úÖ Doesn't close after each command
- ‚úÖ Clear history button works

### üèóÔ∏è **Material Estimation AI** (Blue - Bottom Right)
**Location:** Advanced ‚Üí Material Estimation  
**What to test:**

**Setup First:**
1. Upload a construction plan image (Tools ‚Üí File Upload)
2. Set scale using Scale Tool (Tools ‚Üí Scale Tool)
   - Draw a reference line on a known measurement
   - Enter the real-world length (e.g., "20 feet")

**Then test material estimation:**

#### Test 1: Wall Materials
```
1. Create a layer called "Walls"
2. Use the Polyline tool to draw wall segments
3. Open Material Estimation chat
4. Type: "Calculate materials for walls"
5. When asked, choose: "Lumber (16" spacing)"
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Shows total linear feet found
- ‚úÖ Lists framing materials (studs, plates, nails)
- ‚úÖ Lists surface materials (drywall, screws, compound)
- ‚úÖ Lists finish materials (primer, paint)
- ‚úÖ Shows refinement options (switch to metal, change spacing)

#### Test 2: Refinements
```
After getting wall estimate:
"Switch to metal framing"
"Use 24 inch spacing"
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Shows new calculation
- ‚úÖ Displays material differences (e.g., "Studs: -15 pieces")
- ‚úÖ Updates BOM panel

#### Test 3: Floor Materials
```
1. Create a layer called "Floor"
2. Use the Polygon tool to draw floor area
3. Type: "Calculate floor materials"
4. When asked, choose: "Epoxy Coating"
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Shows total square feet found
- ‚úÖ Lists epoxy materials (cleaner, etching, primer, base coat, top coat)
- ‚úÖ All quantities calculated with waste factors

#### Test 4: BOM Panel
```
After any calculation:
1. Open Advanced ‚Üí BOM Panel
2. View all materials
3. Filter by category (framing, surface, finish, flooring)
4. Click "Export CSV"
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Shows all calculated materials
- ‚úÖ Category filtering works
- ‚úÖ CSV downloads with proper formatting
- ‚úÖ Includes project metadata

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "CORS error" when using AI
**Solution:** Restart Firebase emulators after the CORS fix
```bash
# Stop emulator (Ctrl+C)
firebase emulators:start
```

### Issue: "No OPENAI_API_KEY" warning
**Check:** `collabcanvas/functions/.env` should have:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key...
```

### Issue: AI commands fail silently
**Check Firebase Functions logs:**
```bash
# In emulator terminal, you'll see logs
# Look for errors from aiCommand function
```

### Issue: Material estimation says "no measurements found"
**Checklist:**
- [ ] Scale is set (ScaleTool shows the reference line)
- [ ] Layer name contains "wall" or "floor"
- [ ] Shapes are polylines (for walls) or polygons (for floors)
- [ ] Shapes are on the correct layer
