# Story 1.4: Network Write Optimization (Sync)

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a team collaborating in real-time,
I want efficient network writes and stable sync latency,
so that object manipulation remains smooth and consistent at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Drag writes are throttled/coalesced at ~16ms (â‰ˆ60Hz), avoiding redundant intermediate updates.
2. Median shape sync latency < 100ms and cursor latency < 50ms under harness load.
3. Single Firestore collection listener enforced; no per-shape listeners introduced.
4. Harness gate fails if thresholds are not met; reports saved in test-results.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement adaptive throttling/coalescing in write paths
- [ ] Ensure LWW semantics preserved; no duplicate writes
- [ ] Verify single-listener pattern and document invariants
- [ ] Validate with harness (500+ objects, 5 users) and export reports

## Dev Notes
- Maintain optimistic UI updates for perceived responsiveness
- Profile writes/sec to confirm budget adherence

## Testing
- Integration tests for sync correctness remain green
- Perf harness validates latency thresholds
