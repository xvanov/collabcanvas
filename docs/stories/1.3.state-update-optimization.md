# Story 1.3: State Update Optimization (Zustand)

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a developer maintaining the collaboration engine,
I want minimal store churn and targeted subscriptions,
so that UI renders stay under budget and FPS remains ≥ 60 under load.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Narrow selectors with shallow equality reduce render count by ≥ 50% in hot paths (measured in dev tooling/logs).
2. Under perf harness (500+ objects, 5 users), median FPS ≥ 60 with state churn minimized.
3. No functional regression in selection, locking, and updates; all unit tests pass.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Introduce selector-based subscriptions in `canvasStore`
- [ ] Batch co-related updates to reduce commit frequency
- [ ] Remove redundant derived computations in render paths
- [ ] Validate reductions with profiling and harness run

## Dev Notes
- Preserve store API and single-listener architecture
- Keep actions stable (stable identity) to help memoization

## Testing
- Run unit/integration tests and perf harness; store report artifacts
