# PR-1: Document Upload & Scale Foundation - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Sprint:** Construction Annotation Tool MVP

---

## Executive Summary

Implemented the foundation for construction plan annotation: image upload and scale reference system. Users can now upload construction plans and establish accurate measurements for all future annotations.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Upload Component
**Purpose:** Upload construction plan images to canvas

**Features:**
- ✅ Upload PNG and JPG files
- ✅ Display as canvas background with aspect ratio preservation
- ✅ Center image on canvas
- ✅ Persist to Firebase Storage
- ✅ Sync across users via Firestore

**Technical:**
- Firebase Storage integration
- Aspect ratio calculation and preservation
- Background image layer (non-interactive)
- Firestore metadata storage

### 2. Scale Reference Tool
**Purpose:** Establish measurement scale for accurate calculations

**Features:**
- ✅ Click-drag to create reference line
- ✅ Input known real-world distance
- ✅ Unit selection (feet, inches, meters, cm, mm, yards)
- ✅ Auto-calculate scale ratio (pixels per unit)
- ✅ Visual scale indicator on canvas
- ✅ Apply scale to all new annotations
- ✅ Persist scale across sessions

**Technical:**
- Scale line stored in Firestore
- Real-time sync across users
- Unit conversion system
- Visual reference line overlay

### 3. Unit System
**Supported Units:**
- Imperial: feet, inches, yards
- Metric: meters, centimeters, millimeters

**Features:**
- ✅ Unit selection dropdown
- ✅ Automatic conversions
- ✅ Formatted display with abbreviations
- ✅ Configurable per project

---

## Technical Implementation

### Background Image Flow
```
1. User selects image file
2. FileUpload validates format (PNG/JPG)
3. Upload to Firebase Storage
4. Get download URL
5. Save metadata to Firestore
6. Canvas displays as background layer
7. Sync to all users in real-time
```

### Scale Tool Flow
```
1. User activates scale tool
2. Click to set start point
3. Click to set end point
4. Enter real-world distance + unit
5. Calculate scale ratio (pixels per unit)
6. Save to Firestore
7. Apply to all measurements
8. Display reference line on canvas
```

### Scale Calculation
```typescript
// User draws 100-pixel line representing 10 feet
scalePixelLength = 100 pixels
realWorldLength = 10 feet
scaleRatio = 10 / 100 = 0.1 feet per pixel

// Convert any pixel measurement to real-world
realDistance = pixelDistance * scaleRatio
```

## User Experience

### Upload Workflow
1. Click Tools > File Upload
2. Select construction plan image
3. Image appears centered on canvas
4. Preserved aspect ratio
5. Ready for annotation

### Scale Setup Workflow
1. Click Tools > Scale Tool
2. Click two points of known distance
3. Enter measurement (e.g., "10 feet")
4. Select unit
5. Scale reference line appears
6. All future measurements use this scale

## Integration with PR-2

This PR provided the foundation for PR-2's measurement tools:
- **Background Image** - Construction plans to annotate
- **Scale System** - Accurate real-world measurements
- **Unit System** - Flexible measurement units
- **Persistence** - All data syncs across users

PR-2 built upon this to add:
- Polyline tool (uses scale for length)
- Polygon tool (uses scale for area)
- Measurement display (uses units from scale)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Image Formats:** Only PNG and JPG supported
   - **Reason:** Web browser compatibility
   - **Future:** Could add PDF support if needed

2. **Single Image:** One background image per board
   - **Reason:** MVP simplicity
   - **Future:** Multiple images or image layers possible

3. **Scale Lock:** Scale can be changed anytime
   - **Consideration:** May want to lock scale after first use
   - **Future:** Add lock/unlock toggle

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Upload construction plans (PNG, JPG)
- ✅ Set scale with reference line
- ✅ Choose from 6 unit types
- ✅ Scale persists across sessions
- ✅ Background syncs to all users
- ✅ Scale syncs to all users
- ✅ Performance maintained (60 FPS)

---

## Testing

**Unit Tests:** Covered by integration tests  
**Integration Tests:** Tested in PR-2 annotation workflows  
**Manual Testing:** ✅ Chrome and Firefox verified
