Poor (0-5 points)

Conflict Resolution & State Management (9 points)
Excellent (8-9 points)
Two users edit same object simultaneously → both see consistent final state
Documented strategy (last-write-wins, CRDT, OT, etc.)
No "ghost" objects or duplicates
Rapid edits (10+ changes/sec) don't corrupt state
Clear visual feedback on who last edited
Good (6-7 points)
Simultaneous edits resolve correctly 90%+ of time
Strategy documented
Minor visual artifacts (brief flicker) but state stays consistent
Occasional ghost objects that self-correct
Satisfactory (4-5 points)
Simultaneous edits sometimes create duplicates
Strategy unclear or undocumented
State inconsistencies require refresh
No indication of edit conflicts
Poor (0-3 points)
Simultaneous edits frequently corrupt state
Objects duplicate or disappear
Different users see different canvas states
Requires manual intervention to fix
Testing Scenarios for Conflict Resolution:
Simultaneous Move: User A and User B both drag the same rectangle at the same time
Rapid Edit Storm: User A resizes object while User B changes its color while User C moves it
Delete vs Edit: User A deletes an object while User B is actively editing it
Create Collision: Two users create objects at nearly identical timestamps
Persistence & Reconnection (9 points)
Excellent (8-9 points)
User refreshes mid-edit → returns to exact state
All users disconnect → canvas persists fully
Network drop (30s+) → auto-reconnects with complete state
Operations during disconnect queue and sync on reconnect
Clear UI indicator for connection status
Good (6-7 points)
Refresh preserves 95%+ of state
Reconnection works but may lose last 1-2 operations
Connection status shown
Minor data loss on network issues
Satisfactory (4-5 points)
Refresh loses recent changes (last 10-30 seconds)
Reconnection requires manual refresh
Inconsistent persistence
No clear connection indicators
Poor (0-3 points)
Refresh loses significant work
Reconnection fails or requires new session
Canvas resets when last user leaves
Frequent data loss
Testing Scenarios for Persistence:
Mid-Operation Refresh: User drags object, refreshes browser mid-drag → object position preserved
Total Disconnect: All users close browsers, wait 2 minutes, return → full canvas state intact
Network Simulation: Throttle network to 0 for 30 seconds, restore → canvas syncs without data loss
Rapid Disconnect: User makes 5 rapid edits, immediately closes tab → edits persist for other users
