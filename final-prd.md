## 3) Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Canvas Feature Expansion

#### 1.1 Shape Type System
```typescript
// Extend types.ts
export type ShapeType = 'rect' | 'circle' | 'text' | 'line';

export interface Shape {
  id: string;
  type: ShapeType;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  w: number;
  h: number;
  color: string;
  // New properties
  text?: string;
  fontSize?: number;
  strokeWidth?: number;
  // ... existing properties
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Extend existing Shape component with type discrimination
- Add new Konva components (Circle, Text, Line)
- Update Firestore schema (backward compatible)
- Add shape creation buttons to toolbar

#### 1.2 Shape Editing System
```typescript
// Add editing state to store
interface CanvasState {
  editingShapeId: string | null;
  setEditingShape: (id: string | null) => void;
  updateShapeProperty: (id: string, property: string, value: any) => void;
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Add property editing UI (color picker, size inputs)
- Implement click-to-edit for text
- Add visual feedback for editing mode
- Update Firestore with new properties

#### 1.3 Multi-Select System
```typescript
// Extend selection state
interface CanvasState {
  selectedShapeIds: string[];
  addToSelection: (id: string) => void;
  removeFromSelection: (id: string) => void;
  clearSelection: () => void;
  deleteSelectedShapes: () => void;
  duplicateSelectedShapes: () => void;
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Modify Shape component for multi-select
- Add keyboard event handlers
- Implement bulk operations
- Add visual selection indicators

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

#### 2.1 Color System
```typescript
interface ColorPalette {
  recent: string[];
  saved: string[];
  default: string[];
}

// Add to store
interface CanvasState {
  colorPalette: ColorPalette;
  addRecentColor: (color: string) => void;
  saveColor: (color: string) => void;
}
```

#### 2.2 Undo/Redo System
```typescript
interface HistoryState {
  past: CanvasAction[];
  present: CanvasAction;
  future: CanvasAction[];
}

interface CanvasAction {
  type: 'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE' | 'MOVE';
  shapeId: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

#### 2.3 Layers Panel
```typescript
interface Layer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  shapes: string[];
  visible: boolean;
  locked: boolean;
  order: number;
}
```

### Phase 3: AI Integration

#### 3.1 Command Parser
```typescript
interface AICommand {
  type: 'CREATE' | 'MANIPULATE' | 'LAYOUT' | 'COMPLEX';
  action: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  confidence: number;
}

class AICommandParser {
  parseCommand(text: string): AICommand;
  executeCommand(command: AICommand): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### 3.2 AI Service Integration
- **Option A**: OpenAI GPT-4 API for command interpretation
- **Option B**: Local AI model (smaller, faster, private)
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach (local parsing + cloud AI for complex commands)

---

## 4) Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: AI commands may be unreliable or slow
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple, deterministic commands; add AI gradually
   - **Fallback**: Manual command interface if AI fails

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Risk**: Additional features may impact 60 FPS target
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain current optimization patterns; profile each addition
   - **Fallback**: Feature flags to disable heavy features if needed

3. **Firestore Schema Changes**
   - **Risk**: Breaking existing data or sync
   - **Mitigation**: Backward-compatible schema evolution
   - **Fallback**: Migration scripts for existing shapes

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Multi-Select Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Complex state management for selections
   - **Mitigation**: Leverage existing Zustand patterns
   - **Fallback**: Single-select mode if issues arise

2. **Shape Type System**
   - **Risk**: Different shapes may have different interaction patterns
   - **Mitigation**: Unified shape interface with type-specific behaviors
   - **Fallback**: Start with rectangles, add others incrementally

## 5) Success Metrics & Targets

### Performance Targets (Maintain)
- ‚úÖ 60 FPS during all interactions
- ‚úÖ < 100ms shape sync between users
- ‚úÖ < 50ms cursor position updates

interface FeatureFlags {
  enableMultiSelect: boolean;
  enableShapeEditing: boolean;
  enableAICommands: boolean;
  enableAdvancedFeatures: boolean;
}
```

### Rollback Plan
